  - title: "Aggregate Covariate Analysis"
    desc: >
      This analysis calculates the aggregate characteristics for a Target cohort (T), an Outcome cohort (O) and combiations of T with O during time at risk and T without O during time at risk.
    contents:
      - createAggregateCovariateSettings
      - computeAggregateCovariateAnalyses
  - title: "Dechallenge Rechallenge Analysis"
    desc: >
      For a given Target cohort (T) and Outcome cohort (O) find any occurrances of a dechallenge (when the T cohort stops close to when O started) and a rechallenge (when T restarts and O starts again)  This is useful for investigating causality between drugs and events.
